                You have 6 {presence} tracks. <i>(As usual, you may add {presence} from any track.)</i> 4 of the {presence} tracks are next to rows of Growth choices: these choices start unavailable.
                Upon emptying a Growth track, pick one of its two Growth choices to be immediately available. The other stays unavailable for the rest of the game <i>(cover with a spare piece)</i>.
                <br>
                After you add {presence} from a space marked {energy-gain-1}, gain 1 Energy.

                After revealing an {element}, place 1 Element Marker of your choice on it. That Element is permanent and is constantly available <i>(as if pre-printed on the {presence} track)</i>.
