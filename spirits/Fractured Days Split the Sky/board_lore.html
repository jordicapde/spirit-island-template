            Fractured Days Split the Sky
        </spirit-name>
        <lore-description>
            The sun and moon are short-term timekeepers of Spirit Island, measuring days and months with their rise and set, wax and wane. When they meet in a solar eclipse, time collides with time, sending jagged pieces of Was, Will-Be, and Might-Have-Been tearing through the weave of seasons and years. Gleaming vision-shards of future or past events may shimmer across the sky, but often those futures or pasts do not match what others know.
            <br>
            <br>
            Fractured Days Split the Sky exists mostly in the high reaches of the heavens, but touches the island now and then, time and possibility flowing around it like a wind-blown mantle.

                <setup-title>SETUP:</setup-title>
                <setup-description>
                    Put 3 {presence} on your starting board: 1 in the lowest-numbered land with 1 {dahan}, and 2 in the highest-numbered land without {dahan}. Deal 4 Minor and Major Powers face-up as your initial Days That Never Were cards; in a 1 or 2-player game, instead deal 6 of each. In a 1-board game, gain 1 Time.

                <play-style-description>
                    Excellent at support and sweeping indirect effects, but starts off very limited otherwise. Several of its Unique Powers need setup to use well; it's entirely possible 1 or 2 of them may see no play in a given game.
                    <br>
                    Has a hard time getting lots of {presence} onto the board. This can make targeting tricky, and may be quite dangerous if a Blighted Island effect Destroys {presence}.
