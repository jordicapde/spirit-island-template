                Each {presence} on this ability represents 1 Time. Many of your Powers require Time as an additional cost. Spend it when you <b>Resolve</b> the Power. <i>(Not when you play it.)</i>
                <br>
                When you <b>Gain 1 Time</b>, put 1 of your {presence} here from your {presence} track (or, optionally, the island). When you <b>Spend 1 Time</b>, return it to a {presence} track - or if you have no free spaces, Destroy it.

                Your 3rd Growth option lets you gain any one Power Card from a special set you create during Setup. When you gain a Power Card any other way, you may add one unchosen card to this set.
