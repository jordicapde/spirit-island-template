                Spirit Actions and Special Rules treat your {sacred-site} as Wetlands in addition to the printed terrain.

                For each 2 {water} you have, during the {fast} / {slow} phase you may either:
                <ul>
                    <li>Gain 1 Energy; or
                    <li>Repeat a land-targeting Power Card by paying its cost again. (It need not target the same land.)
                </ul>
                Use scenario markers or spare game pieces to track uses of this rule. (Max 5 times per turn, no matter how much {water} you have.)
