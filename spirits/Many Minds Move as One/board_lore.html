            Many Minds Move as One
        </spirit-name>
        <lore-description>
            A Spirit of flocks, swarms, schools and packs, where the whole moves together in concert to accomplish what the individuals in it could not do alone. Unlike Weaves a Web of Souls, its nature leans towards smaller and simpler creatures, and it regards other sorts of animals - including humans - as bizarrely alien in their individuality; while it will communicate with the Dahan, it has shown no ability (or inclination) to integrate them into itself.
            <br>
            <br>
            While it is willing to sacrifice individuals to protect the whole, it is not a Spirit of sacrifice per se - that is a tactic it employs, not the essence of <br>its nature.

                <setup-description>
					Put 1 {presence} and 1 {beasts} on your starting board, in a land with {beasts}. Note that you have 5 Unique Power Cards.

                <play-style-description>
                    Requires heavy spatial thought for {beasts} movement, due to its improved Push/Gather and large numbers of {beasts}.
					<br>
                    <br>
					Has no offense to start with, but an excellent stalling defense combined with {fear-icon} generation; outright Fear victories may be plausible in smaller games. Both Fear Cards and {beasts} events are unpredictable, however, so swings of fortune are apt to be more relevant than usual.
